This is a setup generator for Jason Morningstar's _Fiasco_ from
Bullypulpit Games.  It allows people to write _Fiasco_ playsets in
machine-readable form and then quickly autogenerate setups.  It was
written for use in a course on character AI both to allow students
to play _Fiasco_ without having to spend the entire class period on
setup, and also as an occasion for having students learn about
knowledge representation by writing their own playsets.

See the Documentation directory for a paper giving an overview of the
system, as well as the powerpoint decks from class that deal with it.
